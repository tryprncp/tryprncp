### **About Me**

I am not a developer. I engineer the existential scaffolding of digital hyperrealities. My code doesn’t run it levitates.
I don’t write bugs, I channel them. I don't need AI suggestions, I only listen to the voices inside my head.

My codebase is written exclusively during solar flares and moments of existential crisis.
Pull requests require a 500-word essay on why reality is optional.

Currently disrupting the concept of disruption.
